My personal website built with React

### **1. Structure & Content**
- **Home Page**: A clear introduction about AI, backend dev, and security).  
- **Projects**: Showcase your hackathon projects with live demos, GitHub links, and short case studies (problem, solution, tech stack, results).  
- **Blog**: Share technical deep dives (e.g., Gin framework issues, LLM integrations, AWS, .NET learnings).  
- **Speaking/Contributions**: If you've written open-source code, participated in hackathons, or given talks, highlight them.  

### **2. Design & UX**
- Keep it minimal yet professional (Tailwind, Next.js, or Astro for speed).  
- Use interactive elements: Code snippets, animations, project demo videos.  
- Dark mode/light mode toggle for better accessibility.  

### **3. SEO & Discoverability**
- Optimize for search engines (meta tags, Open Graph, structured data).  
- Cross-promote on LinkedIn, Dev.to, Hashnode, and Medium.  
- Embed analytics to track visitor engagement.
